These files are practice programs to learn to python.  The problems that these programs are designed to solve come from various 
websites and sources.  One being Udemy.

My shebang line changes on some of the programs.  This is due to my testing and playing with different paths.

Forgive my lack of documentation and any errors.  These are mainly for my testing and knowledge.
